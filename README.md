ASL Alphabet Recognition with Real-Time CNN 


ASL Alphabet Recognition with Real-Time CNN (This project is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It trains a deep learning model on a dataset of ASL hand gestures and then uses the model to classify live video feed from a webcam. The system highlights the detected letter with confidence scores and displays real-time FPS for performance monitoring. Ideal for assistive technology, communication aids, or interactive learning tools for ASL.)
